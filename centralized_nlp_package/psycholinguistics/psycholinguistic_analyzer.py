Additionally, please ensure to store the appropriate settings in the config file. Before moving on to the next step, briefly outline the config management for this code. Also, identify any water variable that is not imported or defined, and arrange for it to be imported from the config files.




You stopped before delivering the entire refactored code in the last step. I understand that it can be overwhelming. Let's break it down and work through one module at a time, addressing each module individually.

Here are a few comments based on observation I made in the unfinsed code: 
 
- Please include  FILT_sections  in the config, using the best storage method. 
- Since all our other modules consist of plain functions, I’d like the refactored code to maintain the same style for consistency. Do you anticipate any challenges with this? 
- All paths starting with  /dbfs/mnt/  come from Blob storage; I prefer these paths to be stored in the Blob config. Please redesign this section. 
- I noticed you initiated  DictionaryModelPreprocessor()  but it’s not being used. As I mentioned, the code isn’t perfect; please identify and remove any unused code to keep it clean. 
- Some functions are lengthy; can we break them into smaller, more manageable functions for better readability? 
- Ensure that docstrings and type hints are properly defined. 
 
Please think innovatively and double-check that the code adheres to the established objectives and practices.
